  the improvement of health and happiness for all.

> When I see that more than 50% of people don't like their jobs, that a large number of people need antidepressants, that the mortality rate linked to illnesses caused by our environment (what we eat, the pollution, stress) is over 80%, I think it's time to create a healthier working environment! An environment where management leads by example with what is good for their personal health, their employees, the environment and where management is human centric focus on the success of everyone, the team, the company and even the community.
