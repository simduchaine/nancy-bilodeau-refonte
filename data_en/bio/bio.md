I had the amazing privilege to work with extraordinary companies such as PWC, Royal Bank, OfficeMax, Sears Holdings Corporation, Abbott, Hydro-Quebec and many others. As a consultant, I worked in various fields such as telecommunications, energy, IT, the pharmaceutical industry, the manufacturing industry and even the retail industry.

I had the good fortune to be recruited during the Dotcom and move to the United States to work for the first Application Service Provider after which I joined one of the biggest players in cellular operating systems, to bring the Internet into our hands.

I started my MBA in California and completed it in Chicago. During my time in the United States, I gave numerous conferences on project management, change management and process modeling.

I also had the honor of receiving with my team in 2012 the PMI Chicago Project of the Year award.

My immersion in the business world was very rewarding and is part of who I am. These experiences allow me to connect more quickly with businesspeople and make a difference for them much faster.
