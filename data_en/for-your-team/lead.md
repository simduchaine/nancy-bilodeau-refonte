title: Energy Infusion
subtitle: I have different tools to energize your team. There are two main axes of
  infusion.

---
The first axis consists in guiding team members to manage their energy. The second axe aims at reducing energy drains caused by team dysfunctions.

In terms of team dysfunctions, I like taking the time to understand your challenges to target the best approach. The biggest energy drains I encounter are : excessive competition, working in silos, interpersonal conflicts, workloads, unattainable goals, varying levels of commitment to priorities, exhaustion due constant change, favoritism, discrimination and tolerance of inappropriate behavior.
