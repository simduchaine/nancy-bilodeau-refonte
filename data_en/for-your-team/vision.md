Our cultures of competition go against this basic principle! Imagine if our cells were in competition rather than in collaboration?! In fact, our cells are always working to give energy where it is most vital, where the body needs it most. Creating this spirit of collaboration, safety and support in your team will energize your players beyond all expectations.
