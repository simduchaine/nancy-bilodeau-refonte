I founded Om Prana Holistic Center in 2013. Located on St-Joseph Street in the heart of the St-Roch neighborhood in Quebec City, the Center offered a vegan and raw food restaurant, a yoga and meditation studio, a health grocery store and several cooking, health support and personal development workshops.

During my three years tenure, I taught many yoga classes and offered detox programs to more than 200 people. Testimonials abound of people who have regained their energy and zest for life, reduced their body pain and increased their clarity of mind. I was also able to deepen my knowledge in integrative health by completing my certification as a health coach with Hippocrates Wellness, a nutrition certificate with Sanoviv Medical Institute, and I also completed my Reiki initiation training, while continuing to expand my knowledge of yoga, meditation and breath work with The Art of Living, Deepak Chopra and Kripalu.

In 2016, working too many hours, I decided to move away from the restaurant industry and return to the business world to apply all my individual skills in the workplace. The experience was most rewarding. The well-being of individuals was quickly reflected in the performance of the teams. Over time, it became clear to me that I wanted to focus on health and wellness with companies.

So, I started Nancy Bilodeau Inc. at the end of 2019, with the dream of creating stimulating work environments that promote health and well-being. Many workplaces are currently toxic, either through their culture of extreme performance or through the dysfunctions of their teams and or processes.

I feel that this was my destiny! My whole journey was building me toward this. Since then, I have continued to expand my skills in integrative health adding things such as Bioenergy and Neuroscience while remaining on top of human resources management and business transformation innovation.

Energy, mindset and neuroscience fascinate me. I am proud to be certified from the SICPNL, NES Health and Bio-Well, and to have completed my MBSR training with Mindful Leader.

"I believe that it is by helping others to nurture their joy for life, by freeing them from suffering and by reconnecting to their essence, that we contribute to the overall well-being of all. We are all here to fully realize ourselves and be happy. Blockages and imbalances are only guides to help us find our way and realize our full potential."

Namaste !
