I have been working with Nancy since 2013. She started by supporting our management teamâ€™s development. Her vast experiences, her communication skills and her proven records as a high-level manager have made a significant difference for our plant. Her training and approaches consider the physical and mental health of each team member. She also inspired me to take even better care of myself. Thanks to her advice and follow-up, I maintain a good lifestyle, exercise regularly and keep my energy high, which allows me to manage many things effectively and cope with daily stress without impacting my life quality and my presence.
