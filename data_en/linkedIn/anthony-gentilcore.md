I have known Nancy for a very long time, well before her professional reorientation. Knowing her critical mind and the quality of her work, I decided to call on her to support my team with stress management and well-being, to ease the effects of the pandemic. I'm impressed with her knowledge and the clarity with which she delivers content that is both provocative and inspiring. It makes us think and makes us discover how we can all take better care of ourselves, in addition to giving us simple and concrete tools. All the employees got something out of it.
