Silence is a powerful tool. A precious moment of interiority to offer oneself, sheltered from the agitation and external stimulations which cut us off from ourselves. Nancy guides us with authenticity and gently to reconnect. I came out aligned, soothed, and centered. I warmly recommend a silence retreat with Nancy to anyone who wants to give their body and mind a space to recalibrate. Namaste! Photo credit: Erick Labb√©
