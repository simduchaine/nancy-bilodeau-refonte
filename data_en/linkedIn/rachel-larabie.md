My great outdoor adventures have come true again. Wow what a joy! I became interested in Nancy’s program out of curiosity and to relieve my chronic joint pain. I also wanted to broaden my knowledge of natural food and integrative health.

From the start, I liked the program spread over 4 weeks with the “remove”, “replace” and “rebalance” our diet approach. I took the opportunity to experiment with the hypotoxic diet with surprising results. I lost weight, but above all regained energy, more enthusiasm, better sleep, better digestion, no more headaches, reduction of my back, arms, and hips pain. A big thank you for everything Nancy!
