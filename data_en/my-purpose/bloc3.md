At 20, I wanted to change the world. I tried to do that by following everyone! Fashion, performance, success. The world changed me and made me sick! In fact, it was rather my lack of health and wellness knowledge that made me sick. And it looks like I'm not the only one to have taken this pathâ€¦

Our world is sick! People are not well. Businesses are not doing well either. Even the planet is sick. We consume its resources too quickly when we should be its guardians. In this unprecedent consumption level of all kinds of processed, synthetic, and even toxic things in search of happiness, we often make ourselves sick. Interestingly, what's bad for the planet is also bad for us. So, what's good for the planet is also good for us! Take for example organic farming; it's good for our land and it's good for our body.

Our pursuit of happiness in success, money and power so valued by our society can add unnecessary stress affecting our physical and mental health.

Currently, we have all the knowledge necessary to change our trajectory. In fact, much of this knowledge has been around for a long time and has been passed down from generation to generation through the teachings of great sages and philosophers. Today, science has proven most of these teachings, but the principles are so simple that it seems like we are floating above this scientific wisdom.

In fact, more health professionals and researchers tell us that the majority of health problems are related to our environment. This means that it is possible to improve our condition if we have the necessary knowledge and a favorable environment.
