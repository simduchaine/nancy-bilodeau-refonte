Companies, by creating cultures of health and well-being (for oneself, others, and the planet) and by providing safe environments both physically and mentally, can completely change our trajectory and transform our society in an accelerated way. while having a positive impact in the lives of their employees, their families, and the people around them.

For example, a company may offer healthy eating education while also offering an exemplary cafeteria menu. Posters across the office can inspire time in nature and an active life. Working hours can be flexible. Leaders may have KPIs related to employee health and well-being just like Bhutan, in South Asia, which has diversified its performance indicators to include happiness. Since they focus on health and happiness, the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is growing.

I have a mix of unique skills that positions me perfectly to support companies in this transformation. With 25 years of business experience in organizational transformation and my last 10 years of research, trainings and experiences in integrative health, I have an in-depth knowledge of our human nature and our needs to live happy and healthy. 

My own transformation is a testimony of this. At 40, I quit a high-paying job to move back with my parents as I was completely dysfunctional and sick. In fact, I thought I didn't have much time left to live. While waiting for death, I discovered the way to health. 

I realized that change starts with me. I took full responsibility for my health and gradually began to apply my knowledge. One thing at a time. I reversed many conditions until I regained 100% of my vitality.
At 50, I am proud to have changed my world and now helping others to do so. When you transform your life, you help change the world. We become the change we want to see in the world. I guide those who are ready to take responsibility for their health and take action. Seeing people regain their joy, health and vitality make me happy.

I want this knowledge to spread faster so that more people can regain their full power and live their best life by using their talents to help others achieve their full potential.
I use my business and my health and well-being competencies to support companies in creating favorable and vibrant environments for individual and organizational health in a way to accelerate our collective health and happiness.
