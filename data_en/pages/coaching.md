My coaching approach is holistic, it aims to look at all the dimensions of a person, a team or a business to help find balance, harmony, optimal well-being and achieve their goals.

We are much more than our physical body. A perfectly healthy physical body does not guarantee a well-balanced and happy person. Just as a sick physical body can be inhabited by a fully realized and happy person!

When looking for well being, here are the key dimensions to explore:

* Physical body health
* Emotional harmony
* Energy flow
* Intellect fluidity
* Soul radiance
* Limiting memories release
* Mind hyperactivity
* Breathing quality
* Lifestyle habits
* Environment quality

My approach is very effective for people who:

* are exhausted
* lack joy of living
* no longer have energy and do not know what to do to find it
* suffer from depression, anxiety, isolation and uncontrolled fears
* want to realize a dream or project but can not seem to find their way
* want to learn how to better manage their stress
* suffer from chronic pain or inflammation and wish to explore alternative methods
* wish to take control of their health but are lost with all the available approaches
* want to lose weight but can not do it despite several diets and multiple trials
* are struggling with addictions and destructive behaviors
* have difficult relationships with others and / or their significant other
