I am inspired by the latest innovations in management and integrative health to heal our corporate world. I combine the latest scientific studies, Sages’ wisdom and the latest breakthroughs in quantum physics and neuroscience to serve you.

Many companies suffer from toxic and dysfunctional environments. The main symptoms are:

* High turnover
* High absenteeism
* Work conflicts
* Significant insurance costs
* Decline in performance

And more!

Many of these companies have implemented different programs to better support their employees and they are often disappointed with the performance of these same programs. It is important to realize that a culture change towards well-being requires engagement from the employees but also from senior management all the way up to the executives.

A state of well-being and health are above all a question of:

* Lifestyle
* Mindset
* Environment

We live in a fast-paced world where employees must constantly learn new things and adapt. They need to be well equipped to take care of their body, mind and emotions to have the energy to keep up without burning out. We live in a stressful world of information overload and misinformation. Providing a healthy work environment that inspires good lifestyle habits and balance will have a positive impact for employees and the company.

I offer also a complete gap assessment analysis to identify the key obstacles to performance and well-being in your company with the creation of an action plan to help you achieve your desired performance. 

My approach consists of reviewing your current results, studying your teamwork dynamic and observing relationship in the field along a good review of your management practices and principles. I also like looking at your insurance cost and key cost drivers. From there I will put forward recommendations based on my expertise in Business and Holistic Health.
