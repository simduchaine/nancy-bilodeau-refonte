**1. 1.	Confidentiality and privacy policy**

Nancy Bilodeau Inc. has a very strict privacy policy. Nancy Bilodeau Inc. guarantees that no personal information will be disclosed to anyone, except during the transactional process aimed at obtaining a credit card authorization or when required by law.

Nancy Bilodeau Inc. is committed to ensuring the security of the data collected and to taking the appropriate precautions to protect your data against loss, fraud or unwanted use.

**2. Monetary transaction security**

Transactions made from the [www.nancybilodeau.com](http://www.nancybilodeau.com/) site are processed by business partners with independent security policies.

You can take the time to read their Terms of Service and Privacy & Security Policy before making your purchase.

If you are not a resident of Canada, a conversion to your local currency will be automatically performed by your credit card issuing institution. Where applicable, unless otherwise provided on the site, please note that delivery costs as well as applicable sales taxes will be added to your invoice.
