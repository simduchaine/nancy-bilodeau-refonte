title: Balance

As the lack of balance led me to illness, this value is primordial to me. I make sure that my clients' goals are achievable and that we can reach them within an acceptable timeframe that will not cause unnecessary stress as we are working together towards health and well-being. I propose approaches adapted to the pace and capacities of all stakeholders.
