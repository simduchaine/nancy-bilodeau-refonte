Lack of coherence makes our world sick! Dr. Korotkov's research demonstrates that disease takes hold in the body when a lack of coherence takes place. The same is true for our businesses. Companies that have a clear vision, clear values, and keep their word provide flourishing places for their employees and their financial statements, while those that lack consistency are more dysfunctional. Company politics can create this lack of consistency. In my mandates, I aim to reduce the friction that undermines coherence.
