The most successful organizations are working together. However, our society highly values competition and undermine teamwork. Our performance evaluation models often reflect this. I find it much more beneficial to foster collaboration and team work to co-create a successful way forward. Everyone has something to contribute and value to add. By working alone, we go faster, but by working together we go further.
