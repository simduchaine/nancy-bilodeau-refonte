The higher a person's level of consciousness, the more that person has a holistic perspective of themselves, others, the community, and all of society. Similarly, each company has its own collective consciousness. Contributing to raising everyone's consciousness contributes to elevating a company for what is best for all. A conscious company makes sure to contribute more than it takes. It is aligned with the needs that drive our society forward with the greatest respect for everyone and our environment.
