This value closely follows respect. When respect is present, it is possible to have harmonious working relationships. In the fast-paced, urgent business world, it's easy to lose that harmony. I make sure that we have the time necessary to accomplish the deliverables and objectives of a mandate so as not to let stress pollute the working atmosphere. I like to use humor to diffuse stress when it is unavoidable. It is much easier to face challenges and find good solutions when you are in a harmonious environment.
