I am often credited for my attentive listening. It is only when you take the time to listen with the intention to understand that you can find the best course of actions and words in each situation. Today's problems are often too complex to solve alone. Listening carefully to the people concerned will make it possible to integrate several perspectives and collaborate to create the tomorrowâ€™s solutions.
