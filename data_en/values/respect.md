We live in a world of diversity. In this wide range of perceptions, ideas, information, and possibilities, I believe it is essential to welcome others with the desire to understand without judging and categorizing, knowing that we can always learn from them. When points of view diverge, it is important to maintain the integrity of everyone involved. We all have our own experiences that have shaped the way we see things. Even if our ideas or our origins differed, we all share this beautiful experience together. Let's be gentle and open.
